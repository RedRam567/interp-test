- fps independant logic
- fixed ticks per second
- buffered average input
- curvy interpolation, not just linear (not perfect, uses weird method, any atempt to use splines was full of dragons)
- player controller
  - buffered average input (reading input as fast as possible, not just once)
  - acceleration
  - friction
- runtime editing of tps and timescale (slow motions, fast motion)
  - modifies player speed/acceleration/friction to remain "identical"
- debug information
  - green circle is current tick position
  - red is previous
  - black is rendered player location
  - I to disable interpolation
  - O to dbg show the tick buffer
  - P to change input averaging strategy
  - green line is last velocity
  - red line is last acceleration
  - blue line is average of all input dir since last tick

missing:
- multithreaded update/draw
- server and client
